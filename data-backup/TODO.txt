- In the immich folder you got the .env file and there: UPLOAD_LOCATION with all the photos and DB_DATA_LOCATION that has the paths to the photos. Both have to be backuped. https://immich.app/docs/administration/backup-and-restore/
- Backup nextcloud data to an external SSD periodically. Probably using rsync
